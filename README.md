# DBFZRecordingTool
This tool provides training mode recording Import/Export for DBFZ as well as audio cues for button presses on playback.
## Instructions
Make sure of three things before you start this program:
1: You're in training mode, loaded and in-game
2: You have uninstalled EAC through its setup
3: You have replaced the DBFighterZ.exe launcher with the one provided (back up the old one, special thanks to @AltimorTASDK)

Once those three things happen, start the .exe.  

## Known Issues
You will have to disable and re-enable audio cues if you reset position.

## Other Miscellania

If there is enough interest, there will be a combo repository where you can download and import others' combos/setups.

Coming features are randomization of a few recordings (probably 3) and the more solidified ability to choose which 3 recordings you would like to randomize between.
